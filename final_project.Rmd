# Introduction 

For this final project, we are interested in the the trends in Hass Avocado sales in different regions of the US and how sales change over time. According to the USDA, the United States has tripled their per capita consumption of avocados  since the early 2000’s, with about 95% of avocados sold being Hass avocados. Along with its taste, size, and longer shelf life, Hass avocados have had greater growing yield in certain regions^[Global hass avocado market: 2022 - 27: Industry share, size, growth. Global Hass Avocado Market | 2022 - 27 | Industry Share, Size, Growth - Mordor Intelligence. (n.d.). Retrieved March 9, 2022 [here](https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/global-hass-avocado-market#:~:text=In%20the%20United%20States%2C%20per,many%20countries%20across%20the%20globe)]. The information under the following dataset is directly reported by retailers describing the price of avocados and the amount they sell. We've filtered the dataset as to only include reports from the Northeast, West, and Plains regions of the US. In addition to region of avocado sales, the data we work with also provide information about date, year, total volume of avocado sales, as well as the type of avocado involved. The dataset reports that type differentiates organic and conventional avocados, which is determined the amount of detectable levels of pesticides residue.

# Exploratory data analysis

```{r}
# Change this code to load your CSV file from the web and do any data cleaning here:
avocado_data <- read_csv("https://wjhopper.github.io/SDS-201/data/avocados.csv") %>% 
  # Select only the needed variables:
  select(-XLarge.Bags) %>% 
  mutate(region = replace(region, region == "NorthernNewEngland", "Northeast")) %>% 
  # Drop rows with missing data for crashes
  filter(region == "Northeast"|
          region == "West" | region == "Plains" ) %>% 
  select(-large_hass_sold, -small_hass_sold, -xlarage_hass_sold, -Total.Bags, -Small.Bags, -Large.Bags)

avocado_data_2016 <- avocado_data %>% 
  filter(year == 2016)
```


## Describe data

Give people a sense for your data by describing:

1. What each observation in each row corresponds to: Each observation corresponds to the average price of a single avocado being sold in a given date and region. 
1. Sample size: There’s a total of 18,259 observations included in the dataset
1. Outcome variable $y$: The average price of an avocado
1. Numerical explanatory variable $x_1$: Total volume of avocados sold
1. Categorical explanatory variable $x_2$ and what the $k$ levels/categories are: Date and year of observation, Region of the observation (which has 6 categories), type of avocado (organic/conventional)
1. Display a snapshot of five randomly chosen rows of data


```{r}
# Change this code to show a random sample of 5 rows of the data:
avocado_data %>% 
  sample_n(5)
```


## Summary statistics

```{r}
# Insert code to output a table of summary statistics:
avocado_model <- lm(AveragePrice ~ year, data = avocado_data)
get_regression_table(avocado_model)
```


```{r}
# Insert code to output a table of summary statistics, but this time
# split by the different levels of the categorical variable:
avocado_mod_categorical <- lm(AveragePrice ~ region, data = avocado_data)
get_regression_table(avocado_mod_categorical)

```


## Data visualizations

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 1: Types of Avocado Average Prices in 2016", fig.align = "center"}
# Insert code to visualize the distribution of outcome variable:
ggplot(avocado_data_2016, aes(x = factor(type), y = AveragePrice)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Type of Avocado", 
       y = "Average Price", 
       title = "Average Prices of Avocados in 2016 (by type)")

```

The median average price for organic avocados in 2016 is much greater than the median average price for conventional avocados. The approximated difference seems to be $0.50. 

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 2: Avocado Average Prices in 2016", fig.align = "center"}
# Insert code to visualize the relationship between outcome variable and numerical explanatory variable:
ggplot(avocado_data_2016, aes(y = AveragePrice, x = Date, color = type)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) + 
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=60, hjust=1))+
  labs(x = "Month", 
       y = "Average Price", 
       title = "Average Prices of Avocados in 2016 (by region)") +
  facet_wrap(~region)
```

Consistently across all regions in 2016, the average price of an organic avocado is greater than its conventional counter part. Specifically, the Northeast and Plains regions seem to have stronger correlation coefficients than their counterpart.

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 3: Total Volume of Avocado Sold in 2016", fig.align = "center"}
# Insert code to visualize the relationship between outcome variable and categorical explanatory variable:
ggplot(avocado_data_2016, aes(y = AveragePrice, x = region)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Region", 
       y = "Average Price", 
       title = "Total Volume of Avocados Sold in 2016 (by region)") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  scale_x_discrete(labels=c("Northeast","Plains","West")) 
```

The median average price of avocados sold in 2016 seems to be much lower in the West than in other regions of the US, with the Northeast having the highest median average price.

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 4: Average Price of Total Volume Sold in 2016 (Interaction)", fig.align = "center"}
# Code to mutate total volume: 
avocado_mutated <- avocado_data_2016 %>% 
  mutate(total_vol_mil = Total.Volume/1000000)

# Insert code to visualize interaction model:
ggplot(avocado_mutated, aes(x = total_vol_mil, y = AveragePrice, color = region)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Total Volume (in millions)", y = "Average Price", color = "Region", 
       title = "Average Price of Total Volume of Avocados Sold in 2016 (by region)") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma)

# Fit regression model:
#avocado_model_interaction <- lm(AveragePrice ~ Total.Volume * region, data = avocado_data_2016)

# Get regression table:
#get_regression_table(avocado_model_interaction)

```

This visualization gives us the insight that the avocado prices in Northeast averages much higher per pound than avocados in other regions. Throughout the regions, as the total volume sold increases, the average price of the avocados decrease. A significant note is that in the Plains, the trend decreases much quicker compared to the other regions. 

```{r, fig.cap = "Figure 5: Average Price of Total Volume Sold in 2016 (Parallel)", fig.align = "center"}
# Insert code to visualize parallel slopes model:
ggplot(avocado_mutated, aes(x = total_vol_mil, y = AveragePrice, color = region)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Total Volume (in millions)", y = "Average Price", color = "Region", 
       title = "Average Price of Total Volume of Avocados Sold in 2016 (by region)") +
  geom_parallel_slopes(se = FALSE) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma)
  
```

Like the previous model, this visualization gives us the insight that the avocado prices in Northeast averages higher per pound than avocados in other regions, followed by avocados in the West and the Plains. Furthermore, as the total volume of avocados sold increases, the average price decreases.  

## Initial conclusions

Write:

- What insight you would tell your grandmother
- Your initial model selection choice, interaction or parallel slopes model, and why.

From the initial glance at the visualizations, we conclude that organic avocados tend to consistently cost more on average across all the regions we highlighted. Furthermore, as the total volume of avocados sold increases, the average price gets less, which might be as a result of wholesale. As for the model selection, it seems like the interaction model would be the best choice since it contains variation compared to the parallel slopes model. Furthermore, the interaction model has additional complexity which can be seen by the additional rows in the interaction regression table, especially with the regression line of the Plains. Thus, we believe the interaction model is a much better representation of the dataset.

# Multiple linear regression

## Regression table

Instructions:

- Indicate which model you selected: parallel slopes or interaction.
- Fit your selected regression model and display the regression table in the code 
block below
- Modify the template formula below from ModernDive 6.1.2 to match your model (this formula is written in the LaTeX typesetting language for printing mathematical formulas)


We selected the interaction model, as there are slopes of the lines in the plots of the interaction model that we believe merits the additional complexity. There is a significant difference between the interaction and parallel slopes model graphs, especially with the Plains regression line.  

```{r}
# Insert code to fit your regression model and show the regression table. 
# Fit regression model:
avocado_model_interaction <- lm(AveragePrice ~ total_vol_mil * region, data = avocado_mutated)
# Get regression table:
get_regression_table(avocado_model_interaction)  

```

## Interpreting regression coefficients

Interpret all regressions coefficients in the `estimate` column in the following list:

For all the slopes, the values are incredibly small since to calculate the slope it would be y/x. Since we are mapping price to y and total volume to x. The avocados in our dataset are worth a maximum $3, while the total volume is millions. Thus, the denominator is significantly larger, making our values for the slopes small. In response to this, we mutated the total volume variable, by dividing it by 1,000,000 which doesn't alter the data, but makes it more accessible and easier to read.  

The intercept term corresponds to the mean average price of avocados of 1.58 dollars in the Northeast. The Total.Volume term corresponds to the slope for the Northeast. For every increase of 1 unit in total volume, there is the associated decrease of on average $0.0757 dollars of average price. This means that in the Northeast, as one buys more avocados, the average price for each decreases (a reason could be due to wholesale). 

The region: Plains term corresponds to the offset in intercept for the Plains relative to the Northeast. Thus, the avocados in the Plains have, on average, 0.0696 dollars of a difference in average price. The Total.Volume:regionPlains term corresponds to the offset in slope for the avocados in the Plains. Thus, for every increase of 1 unit in total volume, there is the associated decrease of on average $0.2236 of a difference of average price. This means that in the Plains, as one buys more avocados, the average price for each decreases (a reason could be due to wholesale).

The region: West term corresponds to the offset in intercept for the West relative to the Northeast. Thus, the avocados in the West have, on average, 0.1071 dollars of a difference in average price. The Total.Volume:regionWest term corresponds to the offset in slope for the avocados in the West. Thus, for every increase of 1 unit in total volume, there is the associated decrease of on average $0.0130 of a difference of average price. This means that in the West, as one buys more avocados, the average price for each decreases (a reason could be due to wholesale).



## Inference for multiple regression

**You will complete the rest of Section 3 at the project resubmission phase due the last day of exams.**

From the above regression table, interpret the confidence interval and p-value for at least two non-intercept terms:

1. Interpretation 1
1. Interpretation 2
1. (optional) Interpretation 3
1. (optional) ...
